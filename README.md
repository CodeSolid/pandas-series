# Pandas Series Outline DRAFT

Goals:

* Develop good SEO content and authority on Pandas. For this we'll create several more articles on aspects of Pandas than we have now.
* Develop a five day mini-course as an offering for email subscribers
* Improve the practice question list https://codesolid.com/pandas-practice-examples/.  Offer the solution set as part of course.

## Earlier "outline"

* "Pandas DataSets" - perhaps one article covering the following:
    * Downloading and unzipping arbitrary file using urllib or requests, plus python zipfile
    * Seaborn [load_dataset](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.load_dataset.html) and [get_dataset_names](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.get_dataset_names.html). 
    * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html

* "Kaggle Datasets" (Full article).  On using Kaggle API to download datasets:  https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#interacting-with-datasets

* Pandas loading dataframe from various types (this has been done a lot)

* Selecting data in pandas.  loc.  iloc.  Others?  SQL Article I have in progress already.

* Data cleaning (one article?)
    * Filling in / handling missing data
    * sklearn has tools for this too?
    * removing duplicates

Data transformation:
    * Vectorized string methods / other string techniques

* Grouping data (already have GroupBy article.  Anything else?)

* Pivot tables and cross-tabulation A lot of this in McKinney's book under "Data Wrangling: Join / Combine / Reshape".  So:
    * Dataframe.combine
    * Dataframe.merge
    * stack and unstack

* Time series data Pandas - A whole chapter in McKinney.  Several articles possible here?
